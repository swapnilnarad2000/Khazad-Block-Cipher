\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Security}
    \textbf{In terms of security:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The most effective attack to find the KHAZAD cipher key is a full search.
        \item Retrieving any information about some Plain-Cipher text pairs using any given Plain-Cipher text pair is as efficient as using complete key search to determine the key.
        \item The approximate complexity of the key search by the full search method is directly dependent on the bit length of the key and is equal to $2^{127}$ applications of KHAZAD.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key Features}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item KHAZAD is much better than most of the available modern ciphers as far as compatibility is concerned.
        \item It's a very fast cipher and it avoids using excessive storage space for all of its code and tables.
        \item Since it does not have uncommon and expensive instructions built for a processor, it is good for most platforms.
        \item The maths included in the creation algorithm is easy to understand.
        \item Since the key schedule is similar to the round function, we donâ€™t require any extra storage.
    \end{itemize}
