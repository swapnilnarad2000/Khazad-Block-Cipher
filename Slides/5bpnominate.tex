    \begin{itemize}
        \item We implemented the key expansion algorithm and the code implementation of the cipher in python language which was not available anywhere and was solely done by us.
        \item We created several figures using draw.io which will be very helpful for people who want to understand KHAZAD implementation algorithm and basic attacks on it. These figures were not available online and were solely made by us.
