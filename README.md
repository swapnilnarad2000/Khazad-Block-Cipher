# Khazad-Block-Cipher
Designed by Paulo S. L. M. Barreto and Vincent Rijmen, KHAZAD was one of the finalists in the first NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and Encryption).

It is a block cipher that has a block size of 64 bits with a key of size 128 bits and uses the fiestel scheme for key expansion.
